These are changes for 4.0.0 release, compared to 3.11.0.
Already done:
- Updated to 26.1-snapshot-5
- Remapped to Mojmap
- Changed namespace from eu.pb4.trinkets to eu.pb4.trinkets
- Moved non-api classes to .impl package
- Reworked slot icons to work more like vanilla:
  - Icons no longer have a background.
  - Moved icon files from 'namespace:textures/gui/slots' to 'namespace:textures/gui/sprites/container/slots'
  - Ids however should change from 'namespace:gui/slots' to 'namespace:container/slots'

Planned:
- Refactor rendering to be more modern / flexible / data driven.
- Refactor definition on trinkets:
  - Components over tags? Fabric has api for adding components to any item, so it should work.
  - Vanilla also defines equipment with components.
  - Modpacks / etc can always use some component modifier mod.
  - Through tags have nice flexibility.
  - Maybe mixed approach?
- General cleanup
